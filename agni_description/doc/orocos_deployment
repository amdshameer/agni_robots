Overview
---------
This package contains lua scripts to deploy orocos component to control the kuka robot among others.

By default, the following scripts start a RTT environment with a deployer and a ROS service to run new lua scripts

* arm.launch
* arm_and_hand.launch
* famula.launch

Test setup
----------

A test setup, deploying a MotionManager, Loggers and kuka controllers is provided
in launch/rtt_deployement_test.launch
>> roslaunch agni_description rtt_deployment_test.launch  LA:=0|1 RA:=1|0



Usage
-----

In order to run your own scripts you can deploy them using the ros service or a launch file using the ros service

* command line 
rosservice call /rtt_environment/Deployer/run_lua_script "PATHTO_agni_description/scripts/cleanup_component.lua"

* launch file
look at the example in launch/rtt_deployement_test.launch




If you are interested in deploying the kukas only, without connecting to anything,
use kuka/kuka_deploy.launch

It will attempt to connect to the motion manager for 5 seconds and start without it if not found.
