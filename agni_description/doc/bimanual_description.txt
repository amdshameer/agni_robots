Describe  2 arms + 2 hands + 1 frame in REAL world and in SIM
-------------------------------------------------------------

- linking all the robots together (linking several files with fixed joints) is not possible within urdf,
    one can only create a single urdf with all joint and links in a single <robot> tag
- gazebo plugins (sr_gazebo_plugin) require the robot_description for the joints they control (and only those)
    one needs to create 4 robot_descriptions for each single robot (2 for arms, 2 for hands) in respective ra/la/rh/lh namespaces
- sr_gazebo_plugin cannot handle dual hand (new real hand driver can now, using serial id to distiguish hands)
    for this reason the hands cannot be spawned in the same robot.
- To ensure the hands are attached with a fixed link to the arm, an arm+hand robot_description is created 
  (hence 2 new robot_description for each side) and spawned into gazebo. They exist in right/left namespaces
  
- right/left are connected together in the tf tree by linking them to the world with a calibration of the base

as a summary (right):
 there are 3 namespaces per side, right/ra/rh

/right/robot_description : for planning and spawning (so that the hand and arm are physically linked together)
/ra/robot_description : used for sr_gazebo_plugin (for pa10 controllers) but NOT used by lwrcontrollers
/rh/robot_description : usef for sr_gazebo_plugin / in real loaded by default by the shadow driver with name rh/sh_description  

/right/joint_states : merged version of the two below
/ra/joint_states : in real world we have a separate js per robot, so create them in sim too
/rh/joint_states : in real world we have a separate js per robot, so create them in sim too

similar for left side

NOTE : when spawning the left/right side, the groupNS is left/right, but the namespace for hand and arm controllers should be ra/la and rh/lf
hand controllers need ns:rh 
kuka gazebo bringup needs ns:ra

There is a /robot_description containing the bimanual setup + frame (+ others) that would be used for planning etc.
