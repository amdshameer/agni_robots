Describe  2 arms + 2 hands + 1 frame in REAL world and in SIM
-------------------------------------------------------------

- linking all the robots together is not possible now requires all joint and links in a single <robot>
- right/left distinction should be possible, just linking them to the world with a calibration of the base

at right :
/right/robot_description : for planning and spawning (so that the hand and arm are physically linked together)
/ra/joint_states : in real world we have a separate js per robot, so create them in sim too
/ra/robot_description : what is this needed for ?
/rh/joint_states : in real world we have a separate js per robot, so create them in sim too
/rh/robot_description : in sim what is this needed for ? / in real loaded by default by the shadow driver with name rh/sh_description : 



there are 3 namespaces per side, right/ra/rh

when spawning the left/right side, the groupNS is left/right, but the namespace for hand and arm controllers should be ra/la and rh/lf
hand controllers need ns:rh 
kuka gazebo bringup needs ns:ra
