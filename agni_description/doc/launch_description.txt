launch files structure choices
------------------------------

it was decided to reproduce the standard launch file structure of some common robots (pr2)

* robot_upload.launch:      upload robot_description to the parameter server
* robot_bringup.launch:     start simulated (load/start controllers) or real robot (start driver)

It was decided to have generic and specific platform launch files

* generic :
    arm_and_hand.launch:    to start any arm+ shadowhand, left/right/both, real/sim
    arm.launch:    to start any arm, left/right/both, real/sim
    hand.launch:    to start shadowhand, left/right/both, real/sim

    platforms.launch:  to start any arm + any end-effector

* specific :
    sfb.launch / famula.launch :   to start the sfb platform, everything is predefined
      these use pre-generated urdfs to speed the launch process
